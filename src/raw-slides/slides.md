# Installing Fedora Server

The first workshop will be to install Fedora Server. This is what we use at Freeside on our VMs, as well as it's counterpart Fedora Workstation on the desktops.  
Firstly you will need to setup a virtual machine of the OS, I used Gnome Boxes but you can use whatever you like, for example VMware Workstation, virt-manager or even something like Proxmox Virtual Environment. It doesn't matter for the most part how it is set up, it doesn't need a lot of RAM, aside from the installer you wont be greeted with a graphical user interface.  
This can be worrying for some, but hopefully through these workshops you will become more familiar with the commandline. If you're already familiar, I hope you can learn something new. Some of these workshops will assume a basic knowledge of the Linux CLI but if you have any issues or are a complete beginner, just ask away as the point of this is to learn.
